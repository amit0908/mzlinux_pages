    quoting this article:

    > Ubuntu,[...] has installed surveillance code. When the user searches
    >  her own local files for a string using the Ubuntu desktop, Ubuntu
    > sends that string to one of Canonical's servers.
    > ......
    > If you ever recommend or redistribute GNU/Linux,
    >  please remove Ubuntu from the distros you recommend or redistribute.

    i686/x86_64 binary. This generally makes Arch quicker to build and
    update, but less customizable than Gentoo which also differs in
    supporting ARM, MIPS and many other architectures.<br />
