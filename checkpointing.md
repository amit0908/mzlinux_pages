[w:Application_checkpointing|Checkpointing]
consists of storing a snapshot of the current application state,
and later on, uses it for restarting the execution in case of failure.

We also put under this header application to detach and reattach processes

[Winswitch](/node/xorg#winswitch "internal reference") also detach and reattach a
process, but from an Xorg session to another, they are put in the
[Xorg section](/node/xorg#winswitch "internal reference").
