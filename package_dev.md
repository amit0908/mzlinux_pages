    ](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/12/15/howto-to-rebuild-debian-packages/)
-   There is a package with packaging tutorials: [packaging-tutorial
    ](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=packaging-tutorial)
    or read the [on line - packaging tutorial (pdf)
    ](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/packaging-tutorial/packaging-tutorial.en.pdf),

## Building Tools
-   The documentation for all the _dh_xxx_ commands are in man pages and referenced in
    [debhelper(7)](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/debhelper/debhelper.7.en.html),

    you find a tutorial for their use in the _Debian Maintainers'_ guide referenced
    below.
-   The package _dh-make_ allows you to take a standard (or upstream) source package and
    convert it into a format that will allow you to build Debian packages.

    _For simple packages, the dh command alone allows us to make a simple and clean
    debian/rules file_  and should be preferred to  CDBS, which is used for complex
    packages like the gnome suite. The _packaging-tutorial_ also tell that for new
    packages we should use _dh_ that is know, from far, the most used build system for
    Debian packages.

# Equivs
[equivs](https://packages.debian.org/sid/equivs) is a tool
to create trivial Debian packages which contain mainly dependency
information, but they can also include normal installed files like
other packages do.

One use for this is to create a metapackage: a package whose sole
purpose is to declare dependencies and conflicts on other packages;
or to circumvent dependency checking
