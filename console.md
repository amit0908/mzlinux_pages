    ( MIT/X11 license) (dynamic virtual terminal manager) brings the concept of
    [tiling window management](/node/desktop#tiling_wm "internal reference")
    used in [dwm](/node/desktop#dwm "internal reference") to the console.
    It allows to work with multiple console based programs. It is in Debian.

        ](http://waxandwane.org/dvtm/dvtm-commands-A4.pdf).
    -   _Dtvm_ itself don't have session management but you can use
        [abucco](/node/checkpointing#abucco  "internal reference") or
        [dtach](/node/checkpointing#dtach  "internal reference")
        to provide the session management.
    -   _Dtvm_ can also be used in an X virtual console.
    -   We can also use in console a [Terminal multiplexor
        ](/node/checkpointing#terminal_multiplexors "internal reference")
        like screen or [tmux](/node/checkpointing#tmux "internal reference").

# Setting console Keyboard and Font
See also [input method](/node/input_methods "internal reference"),

-   The keyboard and font are set at startup with [man:setupcon] from the package
    console-setup.
-   [man:setupcon] default is to read the keyboard configuration from
    `/etc/default/keyboard` which can be overrided by `~/.keyboard`. The syntax of these
    files is given in [man:keyboard(5)].
-   [man:setupcon] read the font configuration from `/etc/default/console-setup`
    overrided by ` ~/.console-setup` whose syntax is given in
    [man:console-setup(5)].
-   You can change `/etc/default/keyboard` by editing it or by running:

        # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

    to activate the new setting run

        # service keyboard-setup restart

-   The same file `/etc/default/keyboard` is also used by Xorg and Wayland to set the
    keyboard.
-   Debian Wiki explains [How to set keyboard layout in initramfs
    ](https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard#How_to_set_keyboard_layout_in_initramfs),
    and _How to enable USB keyboard in initramfs_.
-   A lower level utility to manipulate [man:keymaps(5)] is [man:loadkeys].
-   A lower level utility to manipulate console fonts is [man:setfont(8)]
-   The locale is seen by running [man:locale] without arguments. The default are set in
    `/etc/default/locale` and can be changed by editing this file or running
    [man:update-locale(8)].
-   You can see all locales by running `locale -a`, the available locale are configured
    in `/etc/locale.gen` and can have to be regenerated with [man:locale-gen] when you
    change this file.

## Lower level Utilities

[man:showkey]
:   prints to standard output either the scan codes (`-s`) or the
    keycode (`-k`) or the ascii code(`-a`) of each key pressed.
    _It can be used only on console._

[man:loadkeys]
:   load a kernel keymap for the console.

[man:dumpkeys]
:   writes the current contents of the keyboard drivers translation
    tables

[man:unicode\_start]
:   Enables Unicode processing in the current console.

-   first reload the keys in unicode to produce UTF-8 encoded
    multibyte sequences, instead of single bytes >= 0x80 by
    `dumpkeys | loadkeys --unicode`
-   Tell the console output driver that the bytes arriving are
    UTF-8 encoded multibyte sequences by
    `echo -n -e               '\033%G'`
-   set the font to `$1` and optionally the map to `$2`

# kmscon {#kmscon}
Kmscon is a simple terminal emulator based on linux kernel mode setting (KMS)
_but KMS is not required for Kmscon_.
It replaces the in-kernel VT implementation with a userspace
console.

It does not depend on any graphics-server, like X.org, but instead
provides a raw console layer that can be used independently.

Kmscon provides  full-internationalized keyboard handling, full UTF8
input/font support, hardware-accelerated rendering, multi-seat support
and more.

Kmscon can also run in listen-mode and replace virtual terminals. This
allows to run multiple graphics-servers (like kmscon,  X-Server,
[Wayland Compositors](/node/xorg#wayland "internal reference")
simultaneously on all seats.

-   [ArchWiki: kmscon
    ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KMSCON).
    _kmscon is in Arch but not yet Debian.
-   [kmscon introduction
    ](https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/kmscon-introduction/)
    describe the use of _kmscon_ for [w:multiseat configuration]
-   _kmscon- is build upon [libstm](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libtsm/)
    _Terminal-emulator State Machine_ This library is very similar to libvte but without
    GTK+ bindings, it allows mainly to interpret terminal escape sequences in a Xterm
    compatible way.

    [wlterm](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/kmscon/wlterm/)
    a native Wayland terminal build upon libstm. More explanations in this

# Framebuffer terminals {#framebuffer_terminals}

[fbterm](http://code.google.com/p/fbterm/ )(Frame buffer terminal emulator),
[Archwiki: Fbterm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fbterm)
is a replacement of Linux console terminal that can function outside
of Xorg. The development has stopped _there is still a Debian package_.


[fbpad (git)](http://repo.or.cz/w/fbpad.git),
[ArchWiki: fbpad](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fbpad) is a
small framebuffer terminal that manages many terminals through single
character tags. It is exceptionally lightweight,  written in C and
using its own font format, tinyfont, which avoids xorg font
dependencies. fbpad optionally supports 256 colors, bold fonts, and
saving the framebuffer contents to memory.

[yaft](https://github.com/uobikiemukot/yaft)
is simple framebuffer terminal emulator.  yaft supports UCS2 glyphs
including wide character and 256 color.
