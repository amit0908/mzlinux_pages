    is an extension to XMPP which adds peer-to-peer (P2P) session
    control (signaling) for multimedia.  Interactions such as in voice
    over IP (VoIP) or videoconferencing communications, or also for
    p2p file transfer.  Jingle is supported by Xmpp software based on
    telepathy like empathy, minirc; software base on it like pidgin,
    Coccinella, Gajim, Google Talk, Macabber (file transfer only),
    Pidgin, Psi, Jabbin, Tapioca. It is also supported by telephony
    software like [w:Yate_(telephony_engine)|Yate] or

## Pidgin and Libpurple
<a name="pidgin"></a>[Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) (GPL)
GTK2-based Instant Messaging (IM) application (50M res / 21
shared).
It uses [libpurple](#libpurple "internal reference") which ensure
supports for AIM, Gadu-Gadu, Google Talk, iChat, ICQ, IRC, Jabber,
[w:Jingle (protocol)|Jingle], Lotus
Sametime, MSN, Napster, SILC, Tlen.pl, Yahoo!,and Zephyr.

To have a complete list of protocols look at
[Pidgin Plugins list
](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins).

Since version 2.6 pidgin support video and voice chat support over XMPP,
i.e.  [w:Jingle (protocol)|Jingle protocol]
_the Jabber/Google Talk protocol_.<br />
Pidgin is quite heavy, Pidgin without any extension is 46M res/24M shr.
If you don't run gnome you can still compile it as long as you
don't ask for evolution connectivity. *Pidgin was previously known
as Gaim.*.  Pidgin is documented in:

# Web clients

There are many web clients using Ajax or even java, I scarcely use
them on desktop, because Jabber does not need a full featured
Javascript (or worse Java) enabled brother.  Whenever I'm on a foreign
computer, a jabber client can be very useful, I had used googlechat
but the new _hangout_ has turned into a proprietary protocol.

<a name="bosh"></a>[BOSH  “Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP”
](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/bosh/)
is a technology for two-way communication over the HTTP. BOSH has
been used mainly as a transport for traffic exchanged between
Jabber/XMPP clients and servers. BOSH is more bandwidth-efficient and
responsive than AJAX.  Bosh is supported by Xmpp servers and
standalone XMPP connection managers; [Which BOSH Server Do You Need?
](http://metajack.im/2008/09/08/which-bosh-server-do-you-need/)

# Google Talk and Hangouts

In 2013 Google is in the process of closing Google Talk in favor of
[w:Google+ Hangout] which is part of [w:Google+] an uses  a proprietary protocol.
If you are switching to Hangout you loose the interoperability that XMMP provided.
It is still possible to (for how long?)
to keep Google Talk or to revert back to  Gtalk following the
[FAQ
](https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!category-topic/hangouts/how-do-i/XoWmdBtAIX4)
The menu _revert to old chat_ is still offered as far as may 2016.

With all ssl/tls able clients you can connect for IM with google
talk, you just have to set as server `talk.google.com:5222` with a
tls client or `talk.google.com:5223` for a sslclient, I have
successfully used googletalk with pidgin, gajim, jabber.el, ayttm, jitsi,
psi, mcabber, bitlbee irc gateway. conversejs.

# Secure messaging
Secure Messaging is an essential feature of IM, but these days it is a
mainly used as a selling point, to make you adopt some proprietary
protocol. So you have to convince all your friends to buy the same
product, or to buy yourself all the products owned by one of your
friend, and buy also a more powerfull mobile phone to host these
multiple software. But even if you do it, how can you use the _multi user
chat_ or _group chat_ that is proposed by these software?

Imagine you have to have the same brand of phone to call somebody, the
same email software to read her emails....

To ensure interoperability there is presently few protocols,
[FiSH](#fish "internal reference") the older, obsolete security,
[OpenPGP](#openpgp "internal reference"),
[OMEMO](#omemo "internal reference") which has few clients,
[OTR](#otr "internal reference"). The last one is supported by a fair
number of clients.

I give here also some other open source systems, but even if the
protocol is open source, it is used only by one product.

The first level of security is to use a
x:[Transport_Layer_Security|TLS] connection, that avoid (if correctly
authentified) that your data is stolen during transport. But to be
secure it should provide [w:Forward secrecy], and avoid
[w:Man-in-the-middle attack] by technics like
[w:HTTP Public Key Pinning] (HPKP).

But if it can protect again an occasional hacker taht intercept your
communication, it is of no use when the hacker is member or beak into
the server organisation, or is as powerful as to convince or force the
provider to give its data. And of course it is of no use whent the
data is stolen at one end of the communication, which is so easy with
mobile devices.

-   Wikipedia [w:Secure instant messaging], [w:Secure communication],
    [w:Mobile security],
    [w:Deniable authentication], [w:forward secrecy],
    [w:Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients#Secure_messengers|Secure messengers]
-   [End-to-End XMPP Cryptographic Protocol Desiderata
    ](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/EndToEndXMPPCrypto) from
    [Pidgin developer Wiki](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/).
-   [Propublica: Privacy Tools - The Best Encrypted Messaging Programs
    ](https://www.propublica.org/article/privacy-tools-the-best-encrypted-messaging-programs)
    has a [comparison of security features of secure messaging tools
    ](http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/privacy-tools).

For secure messaging we can expect the following features:

-   encrypted communications between all the links in the
    communication path.
-   end-to-end encryption, i.e the provider does not have access
    to keys.
-   authentication of correspondents e.g. by comparing key
    fingerprints.
-   [w:forward secrecy] i.e. having past communications secure if the
    encryption keys are stolen.
-   open source with documented security design and
    recent independent [w:security audit].
-   no log or store any information  regarding message contents,
    senders and destination, timestamps, sessions or events.
-   Do not rely on a central authority for the relaying of messages
    ([w:decentralized computing]).



## OTR or [w:Off-the-Record Messaging] {#otr}
<a name="otr"></a>[w:Off-the-Record Messaging]
(GPL) Off the Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private
conversations over instant messaging by providing encryption,
[w:Deniable authentication], perfect [w:forward secrecy].

OTR allow instant messaging, secure file transfer,
the plugin supports multiple OTR conversations with the same buddy
who is logged in at multiple locations. MUC is not yet supported.

-   [otr.cypherpunks: Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) Protocol
    Home](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/)
-   [OTR.im: OTR user Home](https://www.otr.im/).
-   [XEP-0364: Current Off-the-Record Messaging Usage
    ](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0364.html)
-   [XEP-0378: OTR Discovery
    ](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0378.html)

We can use any server using TLS for OTR messaging. Some may offer
more security [jabber.otr.im](https://www.otr.im/chat.html) offers
a free and secure server, or even a
[Tor hidden service: ](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en)
their server uses SSL/TLS, but the specific feature is that it
forces communication to be OTR encrypted, thus cleartext messages
between clients is impossible. The server uses full disk
encryption taht will protect all data if the server is powered
off, logging is completely disabled on the Jabber server, even
error logs.

In case of seizure if the server is kept online, the
disk encryption is useless, and one can still see your username
and SHA1 hash of the password, your vcard _if you did provide
one_, your ip address if you don't use TOR, the encrypted content
of offline message and their destination and timestamp, and your
roster including Jabber address of contacts and their name and
group if they are present. What is securely hidden is message
content as they are end-to-end encrypted by OTR, and they have no
logs even you connection timestamps.

You can inspect what provide your server to look if it offers an
comparable level of protection, it seems that for a higher
security you have to go to a P2P connection that avoid completely
the server aspects; but it is beyon Xmmp, hand you will miss many
features.


The main drawback of OTR compared to
[OpenPGP](#openpgp "internal reference") and
[OMEMO](#omemo "internal reference") is the lack of offline
delivery. OTR and [OMEMO](#omemo "internal reference") have
[w: forward secrecy] which lack to
[OpenPGP](#openpgp "internal reference").

For Linux use of OTR see also the
[EFF - Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) guide
[How to: Use OTR on Linux
](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-otr-linux).

OTR is supported by many messaging clients, either a native
support or through plugin. For Linux native support we have:

-   [Bitlbee](#bitlbee "internal rference") since 3.0.
-   [Blink](/node/sip#blink "internal reference")
    a sip client with messaging.
-   [Converse.js](#converse "internal reference")
-   [Cryptocat](#cryptocat "internal reference") protocol _(not open
    XMPP)_ uses OTR for webbrowsers.
-   [Jitsi](/node/sip#jitsi "internal reference") -  Video Calls
    and Chat.
-   [w:Kopete]  multi-protocol messaging for KDE.
-   [Kadu](#kadu "internal reference")
-   [Mcabber](#mcabber "internal reference")
-   [LeechCraft](https://leechcraft.org/) _modular live
    environment_ for Linux, Windows, OSX.
-   [Profanity](#profanity "internal reference")
-   [PSI+](#psi "internal reference")

The following Linux clients have OTR support through a plugin:

-   [bitlbee-otr](https://wiki.bitlbee.org/bitlbee-otr)
    for [Bitlbee](#bitlbee "internal rference")
-   [Off-the-Record Encryption plugin
    ](https://trac-plugins.gajim.org/wiki/OffTheRecordPlugin)
    through [gajim-otr](https://github.com/python-otr/gajim-otr)
    for [Gajim](#gajim "internal reference") _alpha plugin_.
-   [HexChat-OTR](https://github.com/TingPing/hexchat-otr)
    for [HexChat](/node/irc#hexchat  "internal rference").
-   [Irsii-OTR](https://github.com/cryptodotis/irssi-otr/) for
    [irsii](/node/irc#irssi  "internal rference").
-   [pidgin-OTR](https://bugs.otr.im/plugins/pidgin-otr)
    for [Pidgin](#pidgin "internal reference").
-   [poezio](#poezio "internal reference").
-   [Tkabber](#tkabber "internal reference")
-   [Weechat-OTR](https://github.com/mmb/weechat-otr) for
    [Weechat](/node/irc#weechat "internal reference").


Windows and Mac OSX clients

-   Adium  multiprotocol client for Mac OSX.
-   Blink SIP  Mac OSX client
-   [w:climm] IRC for Windows, OSX, and unix.
-   [Kadu](#kadu "internal reference") Unix Windows and Mac OSX
    gadu-gadu and Xmpp client.
-   Textual 5 (OS X)
-   [Tkabber](#tkabber "internal reference")

Android and IOS clients:

-   [Beem](#beem "internal reference")
-   [Chatsecure](#chatsecure "internal reference")
-   [Conversations](#conversations "internal reference")
-   [Xabber](#xabber "internal reference")  GPL Xmpp client for
    Android.

Although Gmail's Google Talk uses the term "off the record", the
feature has no connection to the Off-the-Record Messaging protocol,
its chats are not end-to-end encrypted and could be logged internally
by Google even if not accessible by end-users.

## OMEMO {#omemo}
[OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/)
is an XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP) for secure multi-client
end-to-end encryption. It features
[Future and Forward Secrecy
](https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/)
and deniability while
allowing you to keep the benefits of [message synchronization and
offline delivery](http://conversations.im/#xmpp).

There is a comparison of features of OTR
[OpenPGP](#openpgp "internal reference")
and OMEMO on the
[OMEMO Home page](https://conversations.im/omemo/)

The main drawback of OMEMO is to be supported _as far as year
2018_ only by few clients, the list is given on the page
[Are we OMEMO yet? | progress of OMEMO integration in XMPP clients
](https://omemo.top/).

Beginin 2018 this list include for Linux
an alpha support for [Gajim](#gajim "internal reference")
through the plugin [gajim-omemo
](https://github.com/omemo/gajim-omemo),
[pidgin](#pidgin"internal reference") and _Finch_
through the plugin _lurch_,
[profanity](#profanity "internal reference"),
[Dino](#dino  "internal reference"),
[jsxc](#jsxc "internal reference").


On Mobile we have  the ios client
[chatsecure](#chatsecure "internal reference")
and android client
[Conversations](#conversations "internal reference") and
[Zom](#zom  "internal reference")

On windows there is _Miranda_ and on OS X _Adium_.


## OpenPGP {#openpgp}

[w:OpenPGP] for XMPP was first decribed by
[XEP-0027: Current Jabber OpenPGP Usage
](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0027.html) which is now
obsolete. There is a new experimental draft
[XEP-0373: OpenPGP for XMPP
](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0374.html).

While [OpenPGP](#openpgp "internal reference")
can be used for Xmpp, [OTR](#OTR "internal reference") or
[OMEMO](#omemo "internal reference")
are more secure as they provide [w:forward secrecy], and
[w:deniability] that is missing to OpenPGP, OTR is also easier to
use; on the other hand OpenPGP is a well known and simpler method
of asymetric encryption, and it can be applied easily to offline
messages.

The IM clients supporting OpenPGP are

-   [Conversations](#conversations "internal reference")
    for Android,
    [Mcabber](#mcabber "internal reference"),
    [Pidgin](#pidgin "internal reference")
    with the [GPG/OpenPGP Plugin for Pidgin
    ](https://github.com/segler-alex/Pidgin-GPG/wiki),
    [poesio](#poesio  "internal reference"),
    [profanity](#profanity "internal reference"),
    [PSI](#psi "internal reference"), Gabber, Miranda ICQ
    (IRC/ICQ client for Windows),
    [Tkabber](#tkabber "internal reference"),
    [wija](http://www.media-art-online.org/wija/) _no more developed
    since 2007_. Most are referenced on the [GPG software list
    ](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/swlist.html).

You can find an _HOW TO_ in [Encrypted instant messaging with
Jabber and GnuPG](https://box.matto.nl/gnupgjabber.html).




## Other secure protocols

-   <a name="fish"></a>FiSH is an IRC plugin providing [w:Blowfish].
    encryption to IRC chat. It is an old protocol aimed to IRC, which was
    [proposed in 2009
    ](http://blog.bjrn.se/2009/01/proposal-for-better-irc-encryption.html)
    and never adopted in a RFC.
    You can find it in

    IRC client [AndroIRC](http://wiki.androirc.com/start).
    It is also available in the windows IRC client _mirc_ through a
    plugin.

## Tox Protocol {#tox}

[w:Tox_(protocol)|Tox] (GPL)
is a peer-to-peer instant messaging and video calling protocol
that offers end-to-end encryption. All traffic over Tox is
end-to-end encrypted, and provides  [w:authenticated encryption]
and [w:forward secrecy]. Tox clients aim to provide support for
messaging, group messaging, voice and video calling, voice and
video conferencing, typing indicators, message read-receipts, file
sharing, profile encryption, and desktop sharing.

## Cryptocat {#cryptocat}

[w:CryptocatCryptocat] (GPL) is a javascript encrypted online chatting
application created by [w:Nadim Kobeissi].

It uses end-to-end encrypted chat conversations, and allow to
exchange one-to-one messages, encrypted files and audio/video
recordings. All devices linked to Cryptocat accounts will receive
messages, even when offline.

For the transport layer encryption _Cryptocat_ uses the
[OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption
](#omemo "internal reference"). _Cryptocat_'s network uses XMPP
over WebSockets and only relays encrypted messages and does not
store any data. In addition to the Cryptocat client's end-to-end
encryption protocol, client-server communication is protected by
TLS. It provide [w:forward secrecy] of messages, that is protects
past sessions against future compromises of secret keys or
passwords.

 _Cryptocat_ is available for Linux, windows, OSX.

 [w:Nadim Kobeissi]
 [answering to a request declared on 2016-04-28
 ](https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/issues/77)
 «Cryptocat is no longer offered on mobile devices and will not be
 offered on mobile devices in the forseeable future...»

The main drawback of _Cryptocat_ is that even if it uses a
combination of known open source protocols, you can not
communicate with any other software and you can only encrypt
messages between Cryptocat users, and use Cryptocat server..

messages, attachments and media messages. It uses a modified OTR
protocol, however, without interopability with standard Xmpp networks.

On Android, Signal can be used to send and receive unencrypted SMS
messages in addition to the standard end-to-end encrypted Signal
messages. Signal requires that the user has a phone number for
verification not necessarily the same as on
the device's SIM card; it can also be a VoIP number or a
landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and
have a separate device to set-up the software. A number can only
be registered to one device at a time.

Signal messages and calls are routed through Open Whisper Systems'
servers (in more than 10 countries).

All client-server communications are protected by TLS, but each
message contains as metadata the phone number, which could, if
disclosed, allow to know the time and recipient of call. Open
Whisper Systems have asserted that their servers do not keep this
metadata or any logs about who called who and when.

__Signal Desktop__ is a chrome packaged app that links with the
Signal-iOS or Signal-Android client.

_Signal_ was previously called [w:TextSecure] in November 2015,
_TextSecure_ was merged with an encrypted voice calling application
called _RedPhone_ and was renamed as _Signal_.  The authors of _Signal_
and _TexSecure_ _Whisper Systems_ partnered with _WhatsApp_ in
November 2014 to encrypt users’ messages by default using their
_TextSecure/Signal_ protocol.

Since WhatsApps was sold to Facebook, [w:Brian acton]
who co-founded WhatsApps with [w:Jan Koum], gave $ 50,000,000 to launch
the new [Signal fundation](https://signal.org/blog/signal-foundation/).

## Telegram {#telegram}
[w:Telegram (software)|Telegram] (GPL)
is a cloud-based instant messaging service on Android, iOS, Windows
Phone, Ubuntu Touch and Windows, OS X, Linux. Users can send with
optional end-to-end encryption messages, photos, videos, stickers
_high-definition emoji_ and any file.

Accounts are tied to telephone numbers and are verified by SMS or
phone call.

Default messages are cloud-based and can be accessed on any of the
user's connected devices. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the
encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in
different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical
intruders cannot get access to user data

Messages can also be sent with client-to-client encryption in
secret chats.  Messages sent within a secret chat can be accessed only
on one sender and one reiver device, they can optionally
self-destruct.

There are some critisisms to the [Telegram security
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)#Security)

Beside the IOS, Android, and other mobile applications you find a
windows and Linux Desktop client, and a javascript application for
Firefox and one for Chrome. Users can also access Telegram's
cloud-based messages via an official web browser interface called
Telegram Web (aka Webogram).

There are bridges to XMPP and IRC with
[teleirc](https://github.com/FruitieX/teleirc)

## Whatsapp {#whatsapp}
[w:WhatsApp] __proprietary__ cross-platform instant messaging
client for smartphones.  It uses the Internet to send text
messages, documents, images, video, user location and audio media
messages to other users using standard cellular mobile numbers.
_WhatsApp_ has been acquired by Facebook in 2014.

There are applications for all kind of mobile phone systems,
 WhatsApp Web is a a client used through a web
browser by syncing with the mobile device's connection.

A Pidgin plug-in called whatsapp-purple aimed to XMPP
interoperability was blocked by whatsapp by blocking the phone
itself that used this application.

_WhatsApp_ uses a customized version of XMPP; Multimedia messages
are sent by uploading the image, audio or video to be sent to an
HTTP server and then sending a link to the content, all messages
are first stored on _WhatsApp_ servers then poll the receiver to
ask an ack, when the message is delivered it is dropped, there is
a miximum time of 30 days for delivery.

_Whatsapp_ has shown [many security breaches
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp#Security) even since the
adoption _but unpublished_ of encryption.

As well _Whatsapp_ as displayed
[many privacy problems ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp#Privacy). In
February 2015, a Dutch university studen proved that anyone could
track a _WhatsApp_ user's status and profile pictures, privacy
settings or status messages regardless of their privacy settings.

Sinxe _Whatsapps_ was acquired by Facebook it is sharing data with
the rest of Facebook’s services. Look at

_the CNIL is an independent administrative authority that exercises
its functions with accordance to the French Data Protection Act_.

if you have to use it read the [follwing guides of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation](#eff_whatsapp "internal reference").

There are opensource secure alternatives to _WhatsApp_ like
all the [OTR](#otr "internal reference") and
[OMEMO](#omemo "internal reference")
clients and if you want some mere extension, at the price of
loosing the interoperability,
[Cryptocat](#cryptocat "internal reference"),
[Signal](#signal "internal reference"),

    (GPL) a python library that enables you build application which
    use WhatsApp service. It includes a client application
    [yowsupcli](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/yowsup-cli-2.0)
    that allows you to login and use the WhatsApp service, providing
    encryption of messages. This program can be used for multiple
    purposes as to send message to phones, receive messages from
    network servers or appliances, notifying about issues, via direct
    command or by special agents. There is also a
    [WeeChat](/node/irc#weechat "internal reference") plugin using
    Yowsup library. Yowsup-client is in Debian.

-   [libpurple](#libpurple "internal reference") has a
    [plugin](#pidgin_plugins "internal reference") for WhatsApp.

## Other secure messengers
-   [surespot](https://www.surespot.me/)
    is an encrypted messenger for Android and IOS, the Gihub repo has
    also a javascript node server. _Surespot_ uses 256 bit
    AES-GCM encryption using keys created with 521 bit ECDH
    your key is not stored on the servers, and support voice messages,
    emoji, pictures, multiple identities, multiple devices,
    authentication.

    As many encryption software, one of its drawback is to allow only
    communication with people holding the same software. One other
    havoc is the lack of perfect of forward security.
