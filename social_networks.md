-   [Activity Streams](http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/1359261/FrontPage)
    is an open format specification for activity stream protocols,
    which are used to syndicate activities taken in social web
    applications and services.
    -   [Activity Streams Protocol Home](http://activitystrea.ms/)

Most opensource microblogging frameworks now use the [w:Ostatus]
open standard for distributed status updates. The [W3c Ostatus
Home Page](https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/)
seems quite outdated but the
[Wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/Main_Page)
contains the Ostatus documentation.

Ostatus allows federation of distinct services implementing the
protocol. The [w:Ostatus] protocol is implemented by
the following services in this section:
[Friendica](#friendica "internal reference"),
[Gnu Social](#gnusocial "internal reference"),
[Mastodon](#mastodon "internal reference").

The Ostatus protocol is enhanced by the [w:ActivityPub] protocol which
allow more security for private messages. [w:ActivityPub] is an
extension of the Pump.io protocol.

W3C has a [W3C Recommendation for ActivityPub] and on GithUb the
[AcivityPub Home Page](http://w3c.github.io/activitypub/) and
[repository](https://github.com/w3c/activitypub).

The XMPP based software can communicate together by the XMPP protocol.

[Diaspora](#diaspora "internal reference") uses it's own protocol as
[Pump.io](#pumpio "internal reference").

When no common protocol exist, very often connectors or bridges allow
to communicate using at best a status protocol or at least a messaging
one like the open source IRC and XMPP, or the closed source Slack,
twitter or Facebook messenger.
