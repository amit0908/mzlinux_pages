# Main stream software.

The two more popular and achieved software are written in python
[w:Anki] (GNU AGPL) and  [w:Mnemosyne_(software)|Mnemosyne] (GPL).
Anki has a lot more feature. Anki 2 is based on the
[Sm2 algorithm from Piotr Wozniak](http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm)
the reason to prefer it to other algorithm is
[stated in the Anki FAQ](http://ankisrs.net/docs/dev/manual.html#_what_spaced_repetition_algorithm_does_anki_use). Mnemosyne 2
use also a variant of sm2 algorithm as explained in the
[principles of MnemoSyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/principles.php). They
both are written with QT interface and use a sqlite3 database.

The synchronization is handled by both, but while Mnemosyne use a pair
to pair sync, Anki synchronize thru a central web interface. _Hosted Proprietary
web interface_.

They also both allow plugins but the
[Anki library of plugins](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/)
is a lot richer than the
[Mnemosyne plugins list](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/scripts-and-plugins).

    is an extension for Org mode. Org-Drill uses a spaced repetition
    is uses the [sm5 algorithm from SuperMemo](http://supermemo.com/english/ol/sm5.htm)
    implemented in
    [org-learn](http://orgmode.org/w/?p=org-mode.git;a=blob_plain;f=contrib/lisp/org-learn.el;hb=HEAD)
-   [Learning with Texts (LWT)](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/) (Public Domain)
