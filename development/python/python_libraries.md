# Modules {#modules}
Subset of the
[Python full module index](http://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
([py2k](http://docs.python.org/2/modindex.html)),
The modules not included in the standard library are in the section:
{{< iref "#libraries" "Libraries" >}}.

Some modules are commented in the
[Python Module of the Week - PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/) from
Doug Hellmann.

Frederik Lunch in his
[eff-bot guide to The Standard Python Library
](http://www.effbot.org/librarybook/) also
provides brief descriptions and sample scripts for all standard modules
in the Python 2.0 library, while being outdated, it can still be useful.

The source code of python modules is found in the
[cpython mercurial repository](http://hg.python.org/cpython).


## Data Model {#base_types_modules}

## Embedding Extending
Read first the
[Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter Tutorial
](http://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html) (
[py2k](http://docs.python.org/extending/index.html)).

- [Extending Vs. Embedding](http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/rant/extendit.html)
  explains why you should favor extending upon embedding.
- [swig](http://www.swig.org/) is a multi language binding generator.
  It takes a definition file consisting of a mixture of C code and
  specialised declarations, and produces an extension module.
- [Elmer](http://elmer.sourceforge.net/) is a tool which embeds a Python
  module into a C, C++, or Tcl application. The embedded Python module is
  used just as if it was written in the same language as the application
  itself, without requiring any knowledge of the Python/C API.
- {{< wp "Pyrex_(programming_language)"  "Pyrex (Wikipedia Page)" >}}
  generates the glue  necesary to use C extension for  Python. It goes
  further than swig an pyinline because  it helps to create new python
  extension type. Pyrex  deals with the basic types just  as SWIG, but
  it also lets you write code to convert between arbitrary Python data
  structures and arbitrary C data structures, without knowing anything
  about the Python/C API.
  [Pyrex Home Page](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/)
- {{< wp "Cython" >}} (Apache License)
  is a derivative of the Pyrex language, and supports more features

### Mock objects {#mock_objects}
Gary Bernhardt gives a
[Python Mock Library Comparison](http://garybernhardt.github.com/python-mock-comparison/)
which compare _mock_, _flexmock_, _mox_, _Mocker_, _Dingus_, and _fudge_.

All the following libraries can be used in Python 3.

    is a simple library for doing {{< wp "Mock_object"  "Mock objects" >}} with doctest.
-   [Mock](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/)  is a  library for
    {{< wp "Mock objects" >}} in python including py3k. It is designed for use with unittest.
    It has a very
    [good quality and detailed documentation](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/).<br />
    It is integrated in the standard library as
    [unittest.mock](http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)
    since Python 3.3.
-   [Mox](https://code.google.com/p/pymox/)(Apache License)

     Mox allow to mock the
    public/protected interfaces of Python objects.
-   [Fudge](http://farmdev.com/projects/fudge/) (MIT license)
    is a  module for using fake objects (mocks and stubs).
-   [dingus](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dingus)
    define mock-like objects.  You run your code, using a _dingus_ in
    place of another object or class, and it will record what happens
    to it. Then you can make assertions about what it did to the
    dingus.
-   [flexmock](http://has207.github.com/flexmock/index.html) (BSD License)
    is a mock objects library inspired by the
    [ruby library also named flexmock](https://github.com/jimweirich/flexmock).

    is also a python console browser based on the same project
    [Mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/)
    (BSD License).

    2.3. There was a fork in 2012 [
    retwill](http://bitbucket.org/brandizzi/retwill/);
    it is not yet clear if the project will be maintained.
    -   [Testing Python Web applications using twill and wsgi\_intercept
        ](http://www.advogato.org/article/874.html)
      by Titus Brown.
-   [webunit](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/webunit)
    is a framework for unit testing websites still useful, and used in
    other frameworks like _Funcload_ or _wsgi-intercept_; but badly
    documented and not updated since 2004.
-   [wsgi-intercept](http://code.google.com/p/wsgi-intercept/)
    lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination
    and redirect them into a WSGI application importable by your test program.
    wsgi-intercept allows to do functional _or integration_ tests.
-   [webtest](http://pythonpaste.org/webtest/)

    wrap a WSGI application to allow to test it without starting a
    web server. Since version 1.3.1 WebTest is compatible with py3k.

## Virtualenv {#virtualenv}

-   [Virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/) (MIT license)
    is a python program that creates an environment that has its own
    installation directories, that doesn't share libraries with other
    virtualenv environments (and optionally doesn't use the globally
    installed libraries either).

    It makes a copy of python *(optionally a specific version)* and
    pip local to the local environment. It may use the globally
    installed libraries, or if it does not, install the dependent
    libraries into that environment.

    It is used for testing and deployment as you know
    exactly which libraries, at which versions, are used and a
    global change will not impact your module.

    -   The [Virtualenv PyPI page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/)
        is an install manual.
    -   [Neuroimaging project nypi](http://nipy.org/nipy/)
        has a tutorial : [Setting up virtualenv
        ](http://nipy.org/nipy/devel/tools/virtualenv-tutor.html).
    -   Doug Hellmann has written a case study :
        [IPython and virtualenv
        ](https://doughellmann.com/blog/2008/02/01/ipython-and-virtualenv/).

-   virtualenv is no longer necessary with [python 3 venv module
    ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), that we should use
    now to create Python 3 virtual environment.

-   [virtualenvwrapper
    ](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    (BSD like license)
    by Doug Hellmann is a set of wrappers for creating
    and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development
    workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time
    without introducing conflicts in their dependencies. It is
    compatible with python 3 but does not support [python 3 venv
    ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
    <br />
    Doug Hellmann [does no longer maintain nor use it
    ](https://doughellmann.com/blog/2016/01/03/virtualenvwrapper-needs-a-new-maintainer/).
-   [virtualenv.el](https://github.com/aculich/virtualenv.el)(GPL)
    is an emacs minor mode for setting the virtualenv for the
    Python shell in python-mode.el and python.el
-   [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)
    *not the python 3 script that was used to call venv until 3.6*
    is a bash extension that lets you easily switch between multiple
    versions of Python.

    It intercepts your calls to python, pip, etc., to direct them to
    one of several of the system python tool-chains.  So you always
    have all the libraries that you have installed in the selected
    python version available

-   [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv),
    *installed by [pyenv-installer](
    https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer)*,
    is a pyenv plugin that provides features to manage virtualenvs
    and conda environments for Python on UNIX-like systems.
    with this you can have a base installation that
    includes more than one version of python and create isolated
    environments within each of them
-   [pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
    ](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper)
    is a pyenv plugin which provides a pyenv virtualenvwrapper command
    to manage your virtualenvs with virtualenvwrapper.
-   [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)
    can take your python code, possibly developed & tested under
    VirtualEnv, and bundle it up so that it can run one platforms that
    do not have *your version of* python installed
-   Since python 3.3 the standard python library includes the
    module {{< iref "#venv_module" "venv" >}} which replace
    virtualenv.
