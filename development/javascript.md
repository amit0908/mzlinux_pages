The {{< wp "Ecmascript" >}} specification evolved since the 3rd edition
(December 1999) which is a widely adpted standard, just straightened
in Emascript V5 _ES5_ which was published in 2009, and a new standard
5.1 in 2011. The emacscript V 6
in 2015, named _ES6_ or _ES2015_ is a strong improvement it was
followed in 2016 by the V 7 and 2017 by the V 8. Presentely most modern [implementations
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Implementations) follow at
least V5.1, the {{< wp "V8_(JavaScript_engine)"  "V8" >}} engine which power up
Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, CouchBase, Electon and Node.js support ES6 and
some part of V7 and V8; while {{< wp "JavaScriptCore" >}} that power up WebKit,
Safari, Qt 5 support ES2017 and {{< wp "SpiderMonkey" >}} the engine of
Firefox, Gecko, Adobe Acrobat support 5.1 and partially ES2015 ES2016,
ES2017.

-   Douglas Crockford has written a couple of article very usefull to
    better understand the (lack of) design of javascript and its
    limitations:
    [JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language
    ](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html)
    and
    [The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language Has Become the World's Most Popular Programming Language

    for learning Javascript he recommands _JavaScript: The Definitive

## Ajax

-   {{< wp "Ajax_(programming)"  "Ajax *(Wikipedia)*" >}}
    shorthand for _Asynchronous JavaScript and XML_, is a web
    development technique for creating interactive web applications.
    Ajax incorporates: standards-based presentation using XHTML and
    CSS; dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object
    Model; data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT;
    synchronous data retrieval using
    [XMLHttpRequest *(Wikipedia)*
    ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest)
    ; and JavaScript binding everything together.
-   An {{< wp "Ajax framework" >}} is a web application framework that  provide the
    {{< wp "Ajax (programming)"  "Ajax" >}} engine and
    associated server and client-side functions. It may be a
    {{< wp "Ajax framework#Direct_Ajax_frameworks"  "direct framework" >}}
     when it only provides the basic Ajax components or an
    {{< wp "Ajax framework#Indirect_Ajax_frameworks"  "indirect framework" >}} when the Ajax code
    is generated from the translation of an high level language.
    {{< wp "List_of_Ajax_frameworks"  "Wikipedia list of Ajax frameworks" >}}.


# Javascript tools
-   [JsDoc3 Toolkit](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc)
    is an application, written in JavaScript, for automatically
    generating template-formatted, multi-page HTML (or XML, JSON, or
    any other text-based) documentation from commented JavaScript
    source code.
-   <a name="jslint"></a>[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/l)
    is a _lint_ code quality tool
    for javascript.  JSLint check against a strict subset of
    [Ecma-222 ECMAScript Language Specification, 3rd edition
    ](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-262.HTM)
    and follow the recommendations found in
    [Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language
    ](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html).
    JSLint can operate on JavaScript source, HTML source, CSS source,
    or JSON  text.<br />
    The conventions are summarized in the
    [JSLint instructions page](http://www.jslint.com/lint.html);
    it is very usefull when writting Javascript to make sure you
    follow them, since Javascript makes easy to write clumsy code with
    hidden errors
