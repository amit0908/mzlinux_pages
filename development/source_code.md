# Literate Programming {#literate_programming}

This section is about literate programming and source code
documentation, if you extract both the code and documentation from the
same piece of text, you do
literate programming. If you extract your doc from your program,
you are doing source code documentation. But there is no crisp barrier
between the two concepts.

The two main components in traditional literate programming languages
like {{< wp "WEB" >}} or {{< wp "CWEB" >}} are *tangle*, which produces compilable code
from the source texts, and *weave*, which produces nicely-formatted
documentation.

There is a related

    <a name="antiweb"></a>
    ([Pypi entry](ihttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/antiweb/))
    is an inverse literate programming tool in the {{< iref "#noweb" "noweb" >}} family..
    In opposite to _web_ the documentation is weaved from syntactic correct source code.
    The result is a restructed text file, that can be used in the
    {{< iref "rest#sphinx" "sphinx document generator" >}}.
-   <a name="cog"></a> [Cog](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/) (MIT license.)
    is a code generation tool. It is a preprocessor with all power of python. While
    __Cog__ is mainly aimed at _tangling_ a source file with included python chunks, it
    can be also combined with {{< iref "rest#sphinx" "Sphinx" >}} for documentation
    generation as described in
    [Documentation for python code with reST, docutils, cog and paver
    ](http://oneau.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/documenting-python-code-with-rest-docutils-pygments-cog-and-paver/)

-   [pyWeb]( http://pywebtool.sourceforge.net/)
    is a literate programming tool written in python that combines
    the actions of _weaving_ a document with _tangling_ source files.
    It is independent of any particular document markup or source language.
    It uses a simple set of markup tags to define chunks of code and documentation.
