# Literate Programming {#literate_programming}

This section is about literate programming and source code
documentation, if you extract both the code and documentation from the
same piece of text, you do
literate programming. If you extract your doc from your program,
you are doing source code documentation. But there is no crisp barrier
between the two concepts.

The two main components in traditional literate programming languages
like {{< wp "WEB" >}} or {{< wp "CWEB" >}} are *tangle*, which produces compilable code
from the source texts, and *weave*, which produces nicely-formatted
documentation.

There is a related

-   [www.literateprogramming.com](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)
    is an _outdated_ index of literate programming links and book reviews.
-   [antiweb](http://packages.python.org/antiweb/) (GPL)
    <a name="antiweb"></a>
    ([Pypi entry](ihttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/antiweb/))
    is an inverse literate programming tool in the {{< iref "#noweb" "noweb" >}} family..
    In opposite to _web_ the documentation is weaved from syntactic correct source code.
    The result is a restructed text file, that can be used in the
    {{< iref "rest#sphinx" "sphinx document generator" >}}.
-   <a name="cog"></a> [Cog](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/) (MIT license.)
    is a code generation tool. It is a preprocessor with all power of python. While
    __Cog__ is mainly aimed at _tangling_ a source file with included python chunks, it
    can be also combined with {{< iref "rest#sphinx" "Sphinx" >}} for documentation
    generation as described in
    [Documentation for python code with reST, docutils, cog and paver
    ](http://oneau.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/documenting-python-code-with-rest-docutils-pygments-cog-and-paver/)

    literate programming tool which use a common source file to *tangle*
    a program and weave a latex or html documentation. .

    has semi literate programming support.  It can extract the source code from a
    _LaTeX_ source.
-   The {{< wp "Leo_(text_editor)" "Leo text editor" >}} is an outlining editor which
    supports optional noweb and CWEB markup.
-   {{< wp "noweb" >}}<a name="noweb"></a> is a literate programming tool, created in
    1989 by Norman Ramsey. It has *tangle* and *weave* components as do {{< wp "WEB" >}}
    or {{< wp "CWEB" >}} but is independent of the code language.
    -   [noweb Home](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/).
    -   Noweb has a python clone
        [noweb.py](https://github.com/JonathanAquino/noweb.py)
        that uses the  noweb syntax.

     is a text processing and literate programming tool inspired by
    {{< iref "#antiweb" "antiweb" >}} and {{< iref "#noweb" "noweb" >}}.
-   [PyLit](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylit) (GPL) is a python tool that feature a
    _bidirectional text/code converter_; it can convert between the _code_ form
    and the _text_ form  the _code_  without loss of information.
    [PyLit3](https://github.com/slott56/PyLit-3) (GPL) is a fork for Python3 by Steven Lott.

    runs a python script and captures its output, compiling it to a
    report in a pdf or an html file.
-   [pyWeb]( http://pywebtool.sourceforge.net/)
    is a literate programming tool written in python that combines
    the actions of _weaving_ a document with _tangling_ source files.
    It is independent of any particular document markup or source language.
    It uses a simple set of markup tags to define chunks of code and documentation.

-   [Pweave](http://mpastell.com/pweave/)
    Pweave is a scientific report generator and a literate programming tool for Python
    developed after Sweave. Pweave can capture the results and plots
    from data analysis and works well with numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
    Pweave uses {{< iref "#noweb" "noweb" >}} syntax, but it is also weave a python code between
    `<<>>=` and `@` blocks and include the results and capture matplotlib
    plots in the document. Pweave supports reST, Sphinx, Latex,
    and Pandoc markdown markups. <br />
    For a quick overview look at the
    [example from the documentation](http://mpastell.com/pweave/examples.html).
-   {{< wp "Sweave" >}} is a function in  R that enables integration of R code into LaTeX.
-   {{< iref "org-mode#babel" "org-babel" >}} is a literate programming extension for
